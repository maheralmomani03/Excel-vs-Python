# 📊 Excel vs Python: 70 Days of Accounting Automation Challenge
Welcome to my professional journey of merging **Management Accounting (CMA)** with **Data Analytics**. In this repository, I document 70+ real-world accounting tasks solved using both traditional Excel formulas and powerful Python scripts.

## 🎯 Project Goals
* **Efficiency:** Automating repetitive accounting tasks.
* **Accuracy:** Reducing human error through programmatic logic.
* **CMA Integration:** Applying data tools to Certified Management Accountant core concepts.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
Each day folder contains:
1. `script.py`: The Python automation logic.
2. `README.md`: Explaining the accounting context and comparing the Excel vs Python approach.
